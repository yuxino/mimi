# Single-instance design

## Decision

Mimi is a resident tray application with one settings store, one global
shortcut registration, one audio-session owner, and one overlay set. Register
Tauri's single-instance plugin before every other plugin so a secondary launch
exits before it can initialize any of those resources. A repeated launch asks
the original process to show and focus the settings window; arguments and the
working directory are not interpreted or logged beyond non-content metadata.

On Windows, serialize single-instance bootstrap with a Mimi-owned named startup
mutex. The upstream 2.4.4 implementation creates its mutex before its hidden
activation window, leaving a short interval in which a simultaneous launch can
fail open; it also sends the working directory and arguments with
`WM_COPYDATA` before authenticating the listener. Mimi's local Windows plugin
instead creates the mutex and listener fail-closed, requires exactly one
matching HWND, compares the listener process executable's volume/file identity
with the launching executable, and sends only a registered payload-free
activation message with a finite timeout. Mimi holds the outer gate through the
complete application setup. A background dispatcher queues gate release back
to the original owner thread; the event-loop task runs only after setup has
returned, so activation cannot block unfinished WebView, tray, or shortcut
initialization. Wrong-thread destruction aborts the process and lets the kernel
abandon the mutex rather than failing open. The activation path restores a
minimized or tray-hidden settings window before showing and focusing it.

The Windows CI smoke deliberately delays the primary inside that outer gate,
launches four cold contenders, requires every contender to hand off and exit
successfully within a bound, and proves that the original PID is the only
process left for that exact executable path. It also pre-creates the plugin
mutex without a listener, a matching listener owned by another executable, a
synchronize-only mutex, and a different kernel object with the same name to
prove fail-closed behavior. A zero-byte temporary readiness marker binds the
intended primary before contenders start. The smoke then finds the settings
HWND by exact UI-test title and PID, verifies both minimized-window restoration
and `WM_CLOSE` hiding, and proves a warm launch restores, shows, foregrounds,
and reuses that specific window. This runs for the existing native x64 and
ARM64 jobs.

## Boundaries

- Single-instance CI proves process ownership, handoff, native-window reuse,
  and foregrounded restoration in the runner session. Native acceptance must
  still cover the visible tray icon, taskbar overflow, virtual desktops, and
  DPI scenarios.
- The activation message carries no paths, arguments, subtitle text, audio, or
  credentials. The readiness marker is empty and deleted by the smoke test.
