## Shared Rust subtitle core and Android JNI

The shared core uses Serde for its explicit JSON state boundary. Android uses
the `jni` 0.21.1 adapter and its transitive dependencies to execute that same
Rust core. The locked native dependency inventory and upstream license texts
are in [Android native notices](android/native-licenses/shared-core.txt),
which are included in Android APK assets. See also
[Android third-party notices](android/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).
